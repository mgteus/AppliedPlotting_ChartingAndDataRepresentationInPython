## **Project's title:**

The y-axis' range matters! 

**Read Alberto Cairo’s work, Graphics Lies, Misleading Visuals
Locate an example of a misleading visual that uses one or more of the mechanisms for misleading that Cairo outlines in his book chapter: (1) Hiding relevant data; (2) Displaying too much data and obscuring reality; (3) Distorting data through visual forms.
Please upload an image of this visual using a widely accessible graphic format (e.g., PDF, .jpg, .png)**

## **Name:**

Covid hospital patients in the United Kingdom.

## **Subtitle:**

BBC (UK) presentations of covid hospital cases can mislead the audience to the wrong way.

## **Briefly describe the context for the visual by addressing the following questions:**
  -  **What is the source of the visual? (e.g., URL or bibliographic citation)**
  
  -  **Who is the intended audience (i.e., decoders)? How do you know this?**
  
This image found on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/comments/ktsfjs/at_this_implied_scale_i_think_each_citizen_of/) shows us a visual of four country and their data (from DHSC, Department of Health and Social Care) of covid cases. As this image belongs to BBC UK, the intendend audience is the people in general, I can say that they were aiming almost everyone in UK or even the whole world..
Identify the specific component(s) of the visual that is/are misleading
For each part(s) of the visualization that is/are misleading, identify the mechanism that is used: hiding relevant data to highlight what benefits us; displaying too much data to obscure reality; using graphic forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)
Explain how the mechanisms are used to mislead
We can clearly see that the y-axis in all graphs are not in a correct range for comparsion, as we look to them we can think that Wales has the same amount, at least somenthing close, of covid cases in hospital than England, Scotalnd or even Northern Ireland. It's a clearly case of data distortion, because when the comparsion between countries is made, we would see that all countries has the same amount of cases, wich is not true when England's graph reach more 25,000 cases and Northern Ireland didn't reach 1,000 cases.

**Optional: Describe any additional issues you found with visual that did not fall under Cairo's three misleading mechanisms.**
